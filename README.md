# NLP-Amazon_Alexa_Reviews
NLP is used to analyze (3150,5) reviews to predict users' sentiments; 0=negative reviews, 1=positive reviews. Then we build and train ML classification models like Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and XGBoost. We will also investigate the effects of resampling on the performance of the proposed models.
